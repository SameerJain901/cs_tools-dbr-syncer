        ## *Thanks for your interest in cs_tools!* :tada:

        This project is maintained by the Professional Services and Customer Success
        organizations at ThoughtSpot, meant to augment and enhance usership and adoption
        of your platform.

        That said, it is our passion project! While we make every opportunity to keep up
        to date, resolve issues, well-document our tools, and provide a great
        experience; **if you have a true support issue or are missing critical
        functionality** of your ThoughtSpot platform, we absolutely encourage you to
        reach out to your designated account team!
