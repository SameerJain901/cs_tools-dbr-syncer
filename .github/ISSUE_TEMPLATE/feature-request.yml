        This project is maintained by the Professional Services and Customer Success
        organizations at ThoughtSpot, meant to augment built-in platform tools, help

        That said, it is our passion project! While we make every opportunity to keep up
        to date, resolve issues, well-document our tools, and provide a great
        experience; **if you have a true support issue or are missing critical
        functionality** of your ThoughtSpot platform, we absolutely encourage you to
        reach out to your designated account team!
