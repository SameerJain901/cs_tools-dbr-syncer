# Install Instructions

ThoughtSpot CS Tools are a collection of different tools that assist implementation and
administration, and may contain API calls that we normally wouldn't share with
customers.

The tools and Web APIs are all written in Python and require a Python environment in
which to run. This directory can be zipped and shared directly with customers in order
to facilitate deploying the tools.
