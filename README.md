<p align="center"><strong>CS Tools</strong> <em>- field engineering tooling tuned for
customer delight.</em></p>

CS Tools is an initiative by the CS/PS team to collect, organize, analyze, improve, and
streamline various field engineering tools existing today. This repository is introduced
to form consistency in how we design, build, test, document, and distribute our tools.
In doing so, we are able to streamline our work as well as provide our customers with
the highest level of consultancy that theyâ€™ve come to expect from the team.

## Getting Started

[WIP]

To clone and work this library, you'll need Git and Python 3.6 or greater installed on
your computer. Then, create a virtual environment [Don't know 
[how to do that][bp-venv]?] and activate it.

From your command line:
```console
# Clone this repository
$ pip install git+https://github.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools.git
```

That's it!
