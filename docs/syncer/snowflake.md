??? example "In Beta"

    The Syncer protocol is in beta, it has been added to __CS Tools__ in v1.3 on a
    __provisional basis__. It may change significantly in future releases and its
    interface will not be concrete until v2.

    Feedback from the community while it's still provisional would be extremely useful;
    either comment on [#25][gh-issue25] or create a new issue.

__Snowflake__ is a fully managed SaaS (software as a service) that provides a single platform for data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, data application development, and secure sharing and consumption of real-time / shared data.

__Snowflake__ features out-of-the-box features like separation of storage and compute, on-the-fly scalable compute, data sharing, data cloning, and third-party tools support in order to handle the demanding needs of growing enterprises.

??? question "How do I use the Snowflake syncer in commands?"

    === ":fontawesome-brands-apple: Mac, :fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux"

        `cs_tools tools searchable bi-server snowflake:///home/user/syncers/snowflake-definition.toml --compact`

        `cs_tools tools searchable bi-server snowflake://default --compact`

    === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

        `cs_tools tools searchable bi-server snowflake://C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads\snowflake-definition.toml --compact`

        `cs_tools tools searchable bi-server snowflake://default --compact`

## Full Definition Example

`definition.toml`
```toml
[configuration]
snowflake_account_identifier = 'thoughtspot'
username = 'namey.namerson@thoughtspot.com'
password = 'Really-Hard-Passphrase-to-Crack'
warehouse = 'DATALOAD_WH_XS'
role = 'SYSADMIN'
database = 'CS_TOOLS'
schema_ = 'PUBLIC'
auth_type = 'multi-factor'
truncate_on_load = true
```

[^1]: 
    While Snowflake supports two methods of multi-factor authentication, CS Tools will utilize [Browser-based SSO][browser-sso]. With browser-based SSO, the Snowflake-provided client (for example, the Snowflake JDBC driver) needs to be able to open the userâ€™s web browser. <span class=fc-coral>__Browser-based SSO does not work if the Snowflake-provided client is used by code that runs on a server.__</span>
