??? attention "In Beta"

    The Syncer protocol is in beta, it has been added to __CS Tools__ in v1.3 on a
    __provisional basis__. It may change significantly in future releases and its
    interface will not be concrete until v2.

    Feedback from the community while it's still provisional would be extremely useful;
    either comment on [#25][gh-issue25] or create a new issue.

With Google Sheets, you can create and edit spreadsheets directly in your web browser - no special software is required. Multiple people can work simultaneously, you can see peopleâ€™s changes as they make them, and every change is saved automatically.

<span class=fc-coral>__In order to use the Google Sheets syncer__</span>, you must first configure your local environment. The setup instructions below will help you create a __Google Cloud Project__ and utilize the OAuth Client ID workflow to allow __CS Tools__ to selectively interact with your Google Sheet.

??? example "Setup instructions"

    1. Head to [Google Developers Console][gc-dev-console] and create a new project (or select the one you already have).
        - In the box labeled <span class=fc-blue>__Search for APIs and Services__</span>, search for <span class=fc-blue>__Google Drive API__</span> and enable it.
        - In the box labeled <span class=fc-blue>__Search for APIs and Services__</span>, search for <span class=fc-blue>__Google Sheets API__</span> and enable it.
    2. Go to <span class=fc-blue>__APIs & Services > OAuth Consent Screen.__</span> Click the button for <span class=fc-blue>__Configure Consent Screen__</span>
        - In the <span class=fc-blue>__1 OAuth consent screen__</span> tab, give your app a name and fill the <span class=fc-blue>__User support email__</span> and <span class=fc-blue>__Developer contact information__</span>. Click <span class=fc-blue>__SAVE AND CONTINUE__</span>.
        - There is no need to fill in anything in the tab <span class=fc-blue>__2 Scopes__</span>, just click <span class=fc-blue>__SAVE AND CONTINUE__</span>.
        - In the tab <span class=fc-blue>__3 Test users__</span>, add the Google account email of the end user, typically your own Google email. Click <span class=fc-blue>__SAVE AND CONTINUE__</span>.
        - Double check the <span class=fc-blue>__4 Summary__</span> presented and click <span class=fc-blue>__BACK TO DASHBOARD__</span>.
    3. Go to <span class=fc-blue>__APIs & Services > Credentials__</span>
    4. Click <span class=fc-blue>__+ Create credentials__</span> at the top, then select <span class=fc-blue>__OAuth client ID__</span>.
    5. Select <span class=fc-blue>__Desktop app__</span>, name the credentials and click <span class=fc-blue>__Create__</span>. Click <span class=fc-blue>__Ok__</span> in the <span class=fc-blue>__OAuth client created__</span> popup.
    6. Download the credentials by clicking the Download JSON button in <span class=fc-blue>__OAuth 2.0 Client IDs__</span> section.
