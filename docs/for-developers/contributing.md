## Rule #1: Everyone Can Participate!

We strongly believe everyone in CS/PS can participate, no matter what their technical
proficiency is. Whether you want to act as part of the steering council that decides
the direction of the overall project, be a field expert and liaise between developers
and our customers, roll your sleeves up and git dirty developing new features or
squashing bugs, or even help communicate the cool things the project has accomplished by
writing snappy documentation - rest assured there will be plenty of tasks to participate
in!
