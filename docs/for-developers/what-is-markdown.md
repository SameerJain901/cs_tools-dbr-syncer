# What is __Markdown__?

__Markdown is a way to write content for the web.__

It's written in what people call "plaintext", which is exactly the sort of text you're used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( \* ) and backticks ( \` ).

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people.

__Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve.__

*Technical documentation that just works. Create a branded static site from a set of Markdown files to host the documentation of your project.* We use Material for MkDocs here in the `cs_tools` project. This allows us to do cool things like the admonishment callouts, footnotes, and content tabs - all in a markdown-esque format.
