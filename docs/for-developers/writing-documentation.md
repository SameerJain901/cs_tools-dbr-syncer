MkDocs has been chosen to be our static site generator, as Markdown is an easily approachable format. This is easily extensible and has many plugins already.

*Technical documentation that just works. Create a branded static site from a set of Markdown files to host the documentation of your project.* We use Material for MkDocs here in the `cs_tools` project. This allows us to do cool things like the admonishment callouts, footnotes, and content tabs - all in a markdown-esque format.
