# Tools

ThoughtSpot CS Tools are a collection of different tools that assist implementation and
administration, and may contain API calls that we normally wouldn't share with customers.

```console

Usage: cs_tools tools <tool-name> COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Tools are a collection of different scripts to perform different functions which aren't native to the ThoughtSpot or
  advanced functionality for clients who have a well-adopted platform.
