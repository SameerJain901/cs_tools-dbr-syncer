# :octicons-tag-16: v1.2.0
## :scroll: &nbsp; [Documentation as a first class citizen][gh-release]

### With this release, we're getting a makeover!

Also on the list is a new tool called the Archiver.

> __Archiver__

> As your platform grows, users will create and use answers and pinboards. Sometimes, users will
  create content for temporary exploratory purpopses and then abandon it for newer pursuits. Archiver
  enables you to identify, tag, export, and remove that potentially abandoned content.

!!! tip "Try it now &nbsp; :octicons-terminal-24:"
    `cs_tools tools archiver` [Archiver][docs-archiver]{ .internal-link }

=== ":hammer_and_wrench: &nbsp; Added"
    - this site that you're currently viewing! documentation now has a new home
    - [Dependency Checker][docs-depchecker]{ .internal-link } now supports searching for column and formula dependents
    - [Transfer Ownership][docs-transfer-owner]{ .internal-link } allows you to specify only certain tags or GUIDs[^1] to transfer
    - [Archiver][docs-archiver]{ .internal-link } released!
    - a `--verbose` flag was added to all commands and the configuration file to give more in-depth debugging information
    - help/issue submission via [Google Forms][help]


=== ":wrench: &nbsp; Modified"
    - logging now properly propagates past transient status text

=== ":bug: &nbsp; Bugfix"
