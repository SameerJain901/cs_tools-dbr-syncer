# :octicons-tag-16: v1.2.0
## :scroll: &nbsp; [Documentation as a first class citizen][gh-release]

### With this release, we're getting a makeover!

Also on the list are two new tools called the Archiver and Extractor!

> __Archiver__

> As your platform grows, users will create and use answers and pinboards. Sometimes, users will
  create content for temporary exploratory purpopses and then abandon it for newer pursuits. Archiver
  enables you to identify, tag, export, and remove that potentially abandoned content.

!!! tip "Try it now &nbsp; :octicons-terminal-24:"
    `cs_tools tools archiver` [Archiver][docs-archiver]{ .internal-link }

> __Extractor__

> It's Search, but on the command line! The premiere use case for this tool is to be able to extract
  data from the TS: BI Server worksheet and then load it into Embrace. ThoughtSpot will only store 6
  months of user activity in this worksheet by default, but loading it into an Embrace-connected CDW
  could extend its lifespan further.


=== ":hammer_and_wrench: &nbsp; Added"
    - this site that you're currently viewing! documentation now has a new home
    - [Dependency Checker][docs-depchecker]{ .internal-link } now supports searching for column and formula dependents
    - [Transfer Ownership][docs-transfer-owner]{ .internal-link } allows you to specify only certain tags or GUIDs[^1] to transfer
    - [Remote TSLoad][docs-rtsload]{ .internal-link } now supports a LOT more tsload-native options
    - [Archiver][docs-archiver]{ .internal-link } released!
    - [Extractor][docs-extractor]{ .internal-link } released!
    - an `--temp_dir` option was added to all commands and the configuration file to allow flexibility in saving temporary data
    - a `--verbose` flag was added to all commands and the configuration file to give more in-depth debugging information
    - help/issue submission via [Google Forms][help]

=== ":wrench: &nbsp; Modified"
    - all tools which offered downloadable TML files will now prefer to offer a SpotApp instead
    - logging now properly propagates past transient status text
    - logging should now capture the command issued along with details about the environment and config-user

=== ":bug: &nbsp; Bugfix"
    - tsload service now __ACTUALLY__ handle reroutes from the ETL server load balancer
    - logging now properly handles special characters
    - a pesky "missing permissions" bug which would fail fantastically for no reason
    - `config modify` no longer reverts flag values (--disable_ssl, --disable_sso, --verbose)
