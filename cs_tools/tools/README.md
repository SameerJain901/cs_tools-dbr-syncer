# CS Tools

ThoughtSpot CS Tools are a collection of different tools that assist implementation and
administration, but contain API usage that we normally wouldn't share with customers.
The tools and Web APIs are all written in Python and require a Python environment in
which to run.

By convention, a tool which uses private APIs will have their app directory prefixed
with an underscore.
