This document explains how the tool functions. Minimally, it should show the command
line documentation when invoke your tool's helptext.

Look at this file as giving your Customer Success peers a preview into what solution
your tool offers. If there's a wicked slick pinboard, include an image! If there's an
advanced use case it enables, provide those details. This sort of documentation helps us
all so don't be shy here.

Mostly anything goes since this a Github flavored Markdown file! This file will not be
customer-forward facing, but savvy customers would be able to find and read this text
if they fought hard enough for it.
