# Changelog

---

**DEV NOTE:**
This file should mostly be copied verbatim. A standardized changelog will help us
quickly speak a common language and understand the differences between a customer's
version and the current version.

Changelogs are for people! Keep descriptions short and high level. If we want to see
what exactly changed at a given point in time, we have `git` for that.

All notable changes to this tool will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][keep-a-changelog], and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning][semver].
