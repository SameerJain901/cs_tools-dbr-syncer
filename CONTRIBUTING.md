# Contributing to CS Tools

**Thank you for contributing to CS Tools!**

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to CSTools. There is a lot to do! If you
are not a developer, you can certainly help with interfacing with the clients, triaging
new features and bugs, documentation, and test designing! If you are developer, **no
matter what level** there is certainly a task you can pick up. If you are just starting
out, maybe you want to learn testing and documentation to help understand the basics. We
can also pair you up with a mentor to help further your proficiency.

## Communication

- [Chat and Brainstorm][slack-channel]
- [Project Planning][smart-sheet]

## Contributions

The process is straight-forward.

1. Fork the CS Tools [git repository][repo-master].
2. Write the code for your feature.
    - if you're writing Python code, set up a virtual environment
3. Ensure basic tests work.
4. Create a Pull Request against the [dev][repo-dev] branch of CS Tools

## Pull requests are always welcome
Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Found a bug and know how to fix it? Do
it! We will appreciate it. Any significant improvement should be documented as in 
[Smartsheet][smart-sheet] before anybody starts working on it.
